## Feedback

## TLDR

blah blah blah

## My objectives

I wanted to get feedback on two levels, firstly I wanted to measure myself against objectives which had come out of prior retro feedback, these were:

* Influence
* Amplifying the team
* Servant Leadership
* Higher Level Conversations

<hr/>


## Strategy

I wanted to take a two pronged approach, one which had had some real use in the field, which I took inspiration from some previously used methods used internally within [Readify](https://readify.net "readify web site"), the company at which I work. 

The other would be a an excerise called a Johari window

The first consisted of an publicly accessible anonymous office 365 form with seven questions, only two of which were required

The other is a custom developed implementation of the Johari window excercise which I developed during my [professional development perk here at Readify](https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/companies/readify "Readify's Stackoverflow page").

This hadn't had a lot of testing so was more experimental


I wanted to maximise the response of both of these excercises, but prioritise the feedback form as I assumed it had less chance of bugs / failure

During the final week, I compiled an email internally, this was to make sure that there would be no issue with my feedback form going into spam folders, I then forwarded this email to my work email for following up later

I kept the email light and provided a link to the micosoft form highlighting the fact that it was anonymous


I then provided a quick explanation that I was also doing a Johari window excercise and would appreciate this being completed too

My expectation was that I wouldn't get a high rate of response the first time round and would need an follow up email

# So ...

I sent the email to fifteen people on the client site, these varied between product owners, UX, testers and developers.

I received ten responses to the microsoft office form, by default the information it provides is just average time to complete the form, however you can export the responses to Excel which contains timestamps on their completion.

My Johari Window app, posts the response to Amazons S3 service, which also stores a timestamp when the S3 object is stored.

Using these two series of time I was able to compile a line chart using [Googles fantastic chart offering](https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/linechart "Google's line chart")

The result gives us an idea of the uptake of the two forms of feedback, the

# Overall 

### Key results for objectives

Now back to my key objectives;

### Influence

> he stepped up to influence issues more and showed greater leadership with his peers and RWWA. This is something that he became much more comfortable with which is great


> James was always willing to help me out or work with me to address issues where we had code conflicts and had to resolve them. He did this even when he could have just pushed his changes and made it my issue instead of our issue or his. This was a good example of his inclusive attitude.


### Higher Level Conversations

>Broaden his profile with a wider range of people and squads. I understand that James is a consultant, however to influence a more broader range of people with his skills would be beneficial.

### Amplifying the team & Servant Leadership

> James would leave his emotions at the door and focus on the problem being discussed, letting logic and his experience do the talking. He allowed space for others to contribute their views and remained respectful.

> He had a steadying influence on the teams he worked in and was happy to help out.
