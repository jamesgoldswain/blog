## My objectives

I wanted to get feedback on two levels, firstly I wanted to know measure myself against objectives which have come out of prior retro feedback, these were:

Influence
Amplifying the team
Servant Leadership
Higher Level Conversations


## Strategy

I wanted to take a two pronged approach, one which had had some real use in the field, which I took inspiration from some internal methods used* (credit Will Ray et al). 
The other would be a an excerice called a Johari window

The first consisted of an publicly accessible anonymous office 365 form with seven questions, two of which were required

The Johari window solution was one which I developed during PD (see more here), this hadnt had a lot of testing so was more experimental

I wanted to maximise the response of both of these excercises, but prioritise the feedback form as I assumed it had less chance of bugs / failure

During the final week, I compiled an email internally, this was to make sure that there would be no issue with my feedback form going into spam folders, I then forwarded this email to my work email for following up later

I kept the email light and provided a link to the micosoft form highlighting the fact that it was anonymous

I then provided a quick explanation that I was also doing a Johari window excercise and would appreciate this being completed too

My expectation was that I wouldn't get a high rate of response the first time round and would need an follow up email



## Outcomes

I sent the email to fifteen people on the client site, these varied between product owners, UX, testers and developers.

I received ten responses to the microsoft office form, by default the information it provides is just average time to
