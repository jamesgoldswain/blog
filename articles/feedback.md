# Effective Feedback

Everyone needs feedback all the time to promote personal and professional growth. But what is effective feedback? How do we get it and more importantly how do we measure it?

This is a blog post about an attempt to answer these questions as well as the outcomes from it

## Objectives

As a consultant at [Readify](https://readify.net "readify web site"), personally my tendency on client gigs is to focus on the job at hand. This is beneficial to the them howeve, from a professional development point of view, a lot of information on my personal performance is lost, unless I'm proactive about it.

Unfortunately, so far as I know, there's no obvious tried and tested approach to successfully getting feedback - so let's dig a little deeper :)

First of all, to measure feedback itś beneficial to know what the criteria of what we are measuring

At readify we use the mechanism of ["retros"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective#Software_development "Wikipedia retro article") which are used to determine areas of strenghths as well as ones where we need to focus for improvement

Following a recent set of these, a friend recommended the book ["Measure what matters"](https://www.whatmatters.com/book "Measure what matters book site").

In it, it covers [OKRs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OKR "Wikipedia OKR article") which have been used by some of the top technology companies, I highly recommend reading more about them and the book, but briefly they are ´a framework for defining and tracking objectives and their outcomes´.

Using this as inspiration, to establish my own personal set of OKRs, I wanted to measure myself against objectives which had come out of prior retro feedbacks, which were:

* _Influence_
* _Amplifying the team_
* _Servant Leadership_
* _Higher Level Conversations_
* _Confidence_
* _Public Speaking_

Additionally, I wanted to find out the most _effective format_ of gathering this feedback and being able to benefit from it, by evolving it

## Approach

I wanted to take a two-pronged approach, the first; one which had had some real use in the field, which I took inspiration from some internally previously-used methods within my company 

This consisted of a publicly accessible form with multiple questions, only two of which were required.

The second would be a an exercise called a [Johari window](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johari_window "Wikipedia Johari window article").

This was custom developed implementation of the Johari window exercise which I developed during my [professional development perk here at Readify](https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/companies/readify "Readify's Stack Overflow page").

I wanted to maximise the response of both of these exercises, but prioritise the feedback form as I assumed it had less chance of bugs / failures as it hadn't had a lot of real-world testing. (I´ĺl detail how this worked in a follow up post)

During my final week of the engagement, I compiled and sent an email using my email adrees supplied by the client, this was to ensure that there would be no issue with my request going into spam folders, I then forwarded it to my consultancy work email for following up later

The recipients of the email were 15 colleagues at the client site and varied between product owners, UX, testers and developers.

I kept the contents of the email light and provided a link to the form highlighting the fact that it was anonymous, I also provided a quick explanation that I was also doing a Johari window exercise and would appreciate this being completed too.

My expectation was that I wouldn't get a high rate of responses the first time round and would need an follow up email and that the responses to the Johari excecise would have a lower rate

## So ...


In total, I received 10 responses (~70%) to the form and 7 (~47%) to the Johari window exercise

By using the timestamps on the responses these I was able to compile a line chart using [Googles fantastic chart offering](https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/linechart "Google's line chart")

The result gives an idea of the uptake of the two forms of feedback. From the diagram, we can see that the sending a follow up email improved the responses of by around 60%.

In terms of the Johari Window exercise, we can use the results to form a word tree chart, which basically weights the adjectives people identify us with to give us a high level overview.

## Outcomes

### Key results for objectives

Now back to my objectives and the results. Some great feedback came out of the forms application, I was able to see that I had met my objectives using evidence of key results from the feedback provided:

### Influence

> He stepped up to influence issues more and showed greater leadership with his peers and the company. This is something that he became much more comfortable with which is great.

> James was always willing to help me out or work with me to address issues where we had code conflicts and had to resolve them. He did this even when he could have just pushed his changes and made it my issue instead of our issue or his. This was a good example of his inclusive attitude.

### Higher Level Conversations

> Broaden his profile with a wider range of people and squads. I understand that James is a consultant, however to influence a more broader range of people with his skills would be beneficial.

### Amplifying the team & Servant Leadership

> James would leave his emotions at the door and focus on the problem being discussed, letting logic and his experience do the talking. He allowed space for others to contribute their views and remained respectful.

> He had a steadying influence on the teams he worked in and was happy to help out.

### Confidence

> Earlier on in my time working with him, he seemed happy to keep focused on his work and stay out of the "noise" surrounding the team. However, later on in the engagement, he stepped up to influence issues more and showed greater leadership with his peers and the company. This is something that he became much more comfortable with which is great.

Interestingly, although the Johari window did contain some adjectives such as _confident_ its wasn't surfaced in the responses submitted, by default the exercise uses a standard set of words and it will be worthwhile revisiting this exercise after applying some lessons learnt to it

I feel like for a first run of this experiment I definitely had a decent return of learnings come out of it, I enjoyed pulling together the various instruments of feedback and to use them to measure results and am confident that it will be beneficial going forward.
